# Introducing Bluesky Checkpoints

Bluesky Checkpoints is a little project I started and have hosted on my domain so when people find my Bluesky account which is also my domain they can connect to more people!


# Setup your own instance

Setting up your own instance is pretty easy! All you really need to do is just change out some of the text and also configure the connection.php file to connect to your own MySQL Database.


## Enjoy!
